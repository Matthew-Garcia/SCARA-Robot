# SCARA Robot Pick-and-Place System

This project showcases a SCARA (Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm) I built for high-precision automation.

---

## Overview
- 3D-modeled and printed using SolidWorks.
- Controlled using Python with PID and inverse kinematics.
- Simulated in ROS2 and Gazebo for accuracy and kinematics testing.
